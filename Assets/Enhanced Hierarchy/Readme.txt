Thanks for using Enhanced Hierarchy :)

DESCRIPTION:
Enhanced Hierarchy for Unity is an editor extension that allows you to easily manipulate your Game Objects directly in the hierarchy, it adds a bunch of toggles and buttons in the hierarchy and some information icons.
Are you tired of selecting and deselecting Game Objects just to enable and disable them? Or to change their static flags? Or to change their layer? Then, this extension is made for you, you can do these tedious tasks faster, just clicking on the hierarchy.
Don't you know where those strange errors in your console are coming from? Well, the extension will place an icon next to the game object that is throwing the errors.
Does your partner keeps changing the objects that you don't want him to change? Lock the object and prevent him (or even yourself) from messing with your things.
Do you want a draggable selection on the hierarchy? With this extension you have it, just drag over the items using your right mouse button.
And it is totally customizable, you can enable and disable anything you want.

KNOWN ISSUES:
- Clicking on "Add Tag" or "Add Layer" on certain version of Unity will make it crash, be aware to not click on these buttons (this happens in the inspector too, so it's not a problem with Enhanced Hierarchy, but rather with Unity Editor).

FAQ:
Q: How to use the Enhanced Selection?
A: Just drag over the hierarchy items using your right mouse button.

Q: How to open the settings window?
A: The settings are along the unity preferences, go to Edit/Preferences, you'll see a Hierarchy tab.

Q: The extension disabled itself, what do I do?
A: It might have some errors, and to prevent spamming your console with error, it will disable, or maybe you pressed Ctrl + H, the shortcut for disabling and enabling it, in both cases press Ctrl + H to enable it again. (If it keeps disabling itself all the time send me the errors in your console and I'll fix it)

Q: I see this "OptionalModule.zip" thing in the extension folder, what is it?
A: It's a compiled assembly of the plugin, if you want the extension to be available in all projects without the need to import the package, there is a InstallMe.txt with further explanation and installation guide, you can delete it if you're not going to install.

Q: Debug.Log, Debug.LogWarning and Debug.LogError don't show up on the hierarchy with some scripts.
A: The script need to pass the object in the parameters of the Debug.Log, like this: Debug.Log("Something", this), or use the "print" method.

Q: My game fail to compile if I use the extension, how to fix it?
A: The extension must be placed inside a folder called Editor because it uses the UnityEditor API.
